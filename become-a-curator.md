We are looking to expand the stackage curator team!

As a stackage curator you will help the community by curating and
publishing the widely used nightly and LTS snapshots: Collections of
packages that are guaranteed to play well together. All curators are
volunteers.

This is a great opportunity to contribute to the haskell community and get
familiar with the tools of the trade! You will also be in regular
contact with experienced community members.

We don't have any prerequisites, but familiarity with any of Haskell,
Cabal, Stack, Linux, Git, and Docker is a plus.

We work in shifts of one week, which means you will be on duty every
6th week. Our suggestion is to pair you up with another curator to
help out in the beginning.

The workload is usually about 30 minutes per day, whenever you have
time. The work consists of keeping the builds running on the build
server, filing issues for packages needing updates when new releases
occur, and closing resolved issues. The LTS snapshots are prepared
once a week. All communication with package maintainers happen on
github.

We also have a curator slack channel where we help each other out.

The current curator team consists of:
* Adam Bergmark
* Dan Burton
* Jens Petersen
* Luke Murphy
* Michael Snoyman

We onboarded Luke as the newest member a few months ago and this
helped us iron out and document the process further.
